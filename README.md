# About

Trying to make something worthy out of polls minimal app from django official
tutorial. Added users functionality, good-looking views, and much more details.

## TODO

- Only one vote per question by the same user

- Refactor code and its architecture

- Show results page only for users who have voted on that question

- User profile

- Show users who have selected each choice on results page

- Allow users to create new polls
